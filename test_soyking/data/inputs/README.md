# Inputs Directory
We don't commit any input tables from this directory.

This is an auxiliary directory that we use to test engine when executing locally.

This directory is typically populated (by a data ingestion engine, for example) with a copy of an original data set. Then, other engines will possibly overwrite these files, but not the original ones.
